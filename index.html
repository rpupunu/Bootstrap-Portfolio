                            attended Catholic school most his life. After graduating from Judge Memorial in 2000, he
                            moved to Tempe, AZ where he completed both his undergrad degrees and his MBA at Arizona
                            State University. He holds an MBA in International Business Management and dual bachelors in
                            Chemistry and Business Management. </p>

                            states. After partnering with eBay Motors for a number of years, he went on to sell the
                            company to DealerTrack in 2013. Since then, RJ has had his hand in countless projects,
                            founding multiple companies across a wide variety of industries, and in 2013 his
                            accomplishments were recognized by Utah Business Magazine. In February 2013 he was a
